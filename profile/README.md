# Welcome to Planmatic.io

**Planmatic.io** is an open-source developer platform designed to accelerate the creation of intelligent, interoperable, and fully customizable media investment management solutions.

We believe that advertising deserves a more open and future-proof foundation—one that puts data, algorithms, and AI at the core while keeping users in control. Our mission is to help developers build the next generation of media tools that empower teams to plan, optimize, and analyze media investments with flexibility, intelligence, and interoperability.

Whether you're modernizing legacy systems, building net-new tools, or simply exploring the possibilities, Planmatic provides an open foundation that supports rapid development and seamless integration.

## What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub organization hosts two core repositories that make up Planmatic's open-source foundation:

### [`mediaplanschema`](https://github.com/laurent-colard-l5i/mediaplanschema)

A modular, extensible **open data standard** for structuring media plans. Built on JSON Schema, it allows for:

- Seamless exchange of media plans between systems
- Compatibility with both human and algorithmic workflows
- Full customization for proprietary metrics, dimensions, and taxonomies

Use it to power your planning tools, reporting systems, optimization engines, or agent-based workflows.

### [`mediaplanpy`](https://github.com/laurent-colard-l5i/mediaplanpy)

A Python-based **open source SDK** for working with media plans that follow the open data standard. It provides:

- Easy creation, editing, and validation of media plans
- Workspace and storage management (local and cloud)
- Import/export to Excel and JSON
- Support for analytics, schema versioning, and more

Use it to prototype applications, build automated workflows, or integrate media planning with your broader tech stack.

- **Open by Design**: Avoid vendor lock-in with transparent standards and permissive licensing.
